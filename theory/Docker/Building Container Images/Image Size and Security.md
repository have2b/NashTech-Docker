- It's essential to be aware of both image size and security.
- Size affect to speed download image.
- Security is crucial because container images can contain vulnerabilities that could potentially put your applications at risk.

# Reducing Image Size
- **Use an appropriate base image**
- **Run multiple commands in a single `RUN` statement**
- **Remove unnecessary files in the same layer**
- **Use multi-stage builds**
- **Use `.dockerignore` file**
# Enhancing Security
- **Keep base images updated**
- **Avoid running containers as root**:
``` dockerfile
RUN addgroup -g 1000 appuser && \
    adduser -u 1000 -G appuser -D appuser
USER appuser
```
- **Limit the scope of `COPY` or `ADD` instructions**
- **Scan images for vulnerabilities**: Use tool like [Anchore](https://anchore.com/) or [Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair) to scan images for vulnerabilities and fix before deployment.
