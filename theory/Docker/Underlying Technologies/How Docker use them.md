- When a ***[container](../Introduction/What%20are%20containers?#Definition)*** start, docker will create a set of ***[namespaces](./Namespace.md#Definition)***, so that container will run its own predefined configuration without conflicting with the host or other containers.
- Docker utilizes ***[cgroups](./cgroups.md#Definition)*** to enforce resource constraints on containers, provide a mechanism for monitoring the resource usage of individual containers, which helps to gain insights into container performance and identify potential resource bottlenecks.
- Docker uses ***[Union Filesystems](./Union%20Filesystem.md#Definition)*** to create layered, virtual file structures by overlaying multiple directories. This allows Docker to manage storage efficiently, enabling fast container initialization, resource sharing, and minimizing duplication through mechanisms like copy-on-write. Popular Union Filesystems used by Docker include AUFS, OverlayFS, Btrfs, and ZFS.
