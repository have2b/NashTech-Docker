- ***Docker Engine*** refers specifically to a subset of the [Docker Desktop](Docker%20desktop.md) components which are **free** and **open source** and can be installed only on ***Linux***.
- Includes:
	- Docker Command Line interfaces (CLI).
	- Docker daemon (dockerd), exposing the Docker Application Programming Interface (API)
	- Generally do most things that [Docker Desktop](Docker%20desktop.md) can, but it is Linux only and doesn't provide all of the developer experience polish that **Docker Desktop** provides.
